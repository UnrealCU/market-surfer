# Project TODO

Use this file to keep a simple, human-readable to-do list for the project.

## How to use
- Edit this file directly for quick notes or checkboxes.
- If you want programmatic tracking, use the repository's `manage_todo_list` tool (internal) to keep a structured list.

## XBRL // Edgar

- Improve parsing capabilities to standardize naming convention across different assets


## Volatility 

- Create Implied Volatility plane using option chain 
- Try different mathematical methods for deriving volatility


## Trading Strategy 

- Build a hypothesis and test different trading ideas

## Add-ons/non-priority

- AI reading of financial discloses, which derives sentiment analysis 
- Improve API/data source for better capabilities + larger data set

---

Notes:
- Keep items concise. Use owner initials and ETA if helpful.
- If you want, I can also create a `todo.json` that mirrors this file and syncs with the `manage_todo_list` tool.
